   ⚠️  MOVED TO ORGANIZED STRUCTURE
   ================================================================
   
   This file has been reorganized into the /styles folder structure.
   All imports are now handled through /styles/index.css
   
   The new structure is:
   - /styles/foundation/     (variables, reset, typography, breakpoints)  
   - /styles/tokens/         (colors, spacing, shadows, gradients, borders)
   - /styles/layout/         (grid, flexbox, containers, positioning)
   - /styles/components/     (buttons, cards, navigation, feedback)
   - /styles/utilities/      (scrollbars, animations, accessibility, responsive, themes)
   
   Main import is now: './styles/index.css' in main.tsx
