# Initial Context Setup

I'm working on a React TypeScript portfolio implementation for Sunny Dodti. This is part of a multi-technology portfolio ecosystem. Here's the key context:

**Project**: React implementation of Sunny Dodti's professional portfolio
**Tech Stack**: React 18+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite, React Router
**Design**: Dark theme, sidebar layout, single viewport (no scrolling)
**Data Source**: Fetches from main repository's JSON endpoints
**Local Context**: `/context/` folder contains wireframes, data samples, and style guides

**Key Requirements**:

1. Follow wireframes in `/context/wireframes/` exactly
2. Use design tokens from `/context/data/styles/style.json`
3. Implement TypeScript strictly (no `any` types)
4. Maintain Tailwind utility-first approach
5. Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)
6. Target Lighthouse score 95+
7. Follow WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards

**Project Structure**:

- Components in `/src/components/` (layout, common, sections)
- Pages in `/src/pages/`
- Types in `/src/types/`
- Hooks in `/src/hooks/`
- Context files for reference in `/context/`

Please help me with development tasks while adhering to these standards and maintaining consistency with the broader portfolio ecosystem.
