# Debugging and Issue Resolution

I'm encountering an issue in the React portfolio that needs diagnosis and resolution.

**Problem Context**:

- **Issue Type**: [Component behavior, build error, styling issue, performance problem, etc.]
- **Affected Area**: [Specific component, page, or feature]
- **Environment**: [Development, build, testing, production]
- **Browser/Device**: [Chrome, Firefox, Safari, mobile, etc.]

**Issue Details**:

- **Expected Behavior**: What should happen according to wireframes and specifications
- **Actual Behavior**: What is currently happening
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Specific actions that trigger the issue
- **Error Messages**: Any console errors, TypeScript errors, or build errors
- **Screenshots/Videos**: Visual evidence of the problem

**Project Constraints**:

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Must maintain strict typing (no `any` types)
- **Design Fidelity**: Must match wireframes in `/context/wireframes/`
- **Accessibility**: Must preserve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance**: Must maintain Lighthouse score 95+
- **Component Patterns**: Must follow our established patterns
- **Design System**: Must use colors from style tokens only

**Debugging Areas to Check**:

**Component Issues**:

- Props interface and TypeScript errors
- State management and updates
- Effect dependencies and cleanup
- Event handler implementations
- Conditional rendering logic
- Component lifecycle issues

**Styling Problems**:

- CSS variable conflicts or missing custom properties
- CSS custom property application
- Responsive behavior across breakpoints
- Dark/light theme implementation
- Design token usage vs hardcoded values
- Z-index and positioning issues

**Data Issues**:

- API fetch failures and fallbacks
- Data transformation and typing
- Loading and error state handling
- Context provider setup
- Hook dependencies and updates

**Build/Configuration Issues**:

- Vite configuration problems
- TypeScript compilation errors
- ESLint rule violations
- Import path resolution
- Asset loading and optimization
- Environment variable access

**Performance Issues**:

- Unnecessary re-renders
- Bundle size problems
- Memory leaks
- Slow interactions
- Image loading optimization
- Code splitting effectiveness

**Accessibility Issues**:

- Keyboard navigation problems
- Screen reader compatibility
- ARIA attribute issues
- Color contrast failures
- Focus management problems

**Diagnostic Tools**:

- React DevTools for component debugging
- Chrome DevTools for performance analysis
- TypeScript compiler for type checking
- ESLint for code quality issues
- Lighthouse for performance auditing
- axe-core for accessibility testing

**Resolution Requirements**:

- Maintain all existing functionality
- Preserve TypeScript strict mode
- Keep accessibility features intact
- Maintain performance standards
- Follow our component patterns
- Match wireframe specifications exactly

Please help diagnose the root cause and provide a solution that addresses the issue while maintaining all project standards and constraints.
