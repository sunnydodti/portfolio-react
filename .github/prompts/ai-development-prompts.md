# Portfolio React - AI Development Prompts

## ü§ñ Context Awareness Prompts

Use these prompts when working with AI assistants on the portfolio-react repository to ensure proper context and adherence to project standards.

---

## üìã Initial Context Prompt

```
I'm working on a React TypeScript portfolio implementation for Sunny Dodti. This is part of a multi-technology portfolio ecosystem. Here's the key context:

**Project**: React implementation of Sunny Dodti's professional portfolio
**Tech Stack**: React 18+, TypeScript, Vanilla CSS with CSS Variables, Vite, React Router
**Design**: Visually stunning modern portfolio with scrollable sections and rich visual effects
**Data Source**: Fetches from main repository's JSON endpoints
**Local Context**: `/context/` folder contains wireframes, data samples, and style guides

**Key Requirements**:
1. **CREATE VISUALLY GORGEOUS DESIGN** - Focus on stunning visual appeal and modern aesthetics
2. Use wireframes in `/project-context/wireframes/` as layout structure reference only (NOT exact design - just building blocks)
3. Follow the beautiful color palette from `/data/styles/pallet-demo-dark-light.html` for actual styling
4. Add rich visual elements: gradients, shadows, animations, micro-interactions
5. Allow natural scrolling with smooth section transitions and animations
6. Use design tokens from `/project-context/data/styles/style.json`
7. Implement TypeScript strictly (no `any` types)
8. Maintain CSS variables and semantic class approach
9. Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)
10. Target Lighthouse score 95+
11. Follow WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards

Please help me with [SPECIFIC_TASK] while adhering to these standards.
```

**Required Props**: [PROP_LIST]
**Styling Requirements**:
- Use CSS variables and semantic classes following our design system
- Dark theme colors from style tokens
- Responsive behavior: [BREAKPOINT_REQUIREMENTS]
- Accessibility features: [A11Y_REQUIREMENTS]

Please create a TypeScript React component that matches the wireframe exactly, includes proper prop types, and follows our styling guidelines.
```

### Refactoring Components

```
I need to refactor an existing component to better match our standards:

**Current Component**: [COMPONENT_PATH]
**Issues**: [LIST_OF_ISSUES]
**Wireframe Reference**: [WIREFRAME_SECTION]
**Requirements**:
- Improve TypeScript types
- Optimize CSS classes and variables
- Enhance accessibility
- Match wireframe design more closely
- Maintain existing functionality

Please refactor this component while preserving all current features.
```
